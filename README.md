Welcome to my portfolio site!
The purpose of this site is to let my audience get to know me a little more. I dive into my hobbies, interests, and career goals.
In addition to getting to know me, the site showcases my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js.
For example, I made the site responsive using Flexbox and media queries, connected to a database, and implemented a Vue app.
Thank you for visiting!
